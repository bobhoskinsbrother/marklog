# Welcome to the Blogosphere

This is a demo blog in marklog, a piece of blog writing and publishing software.

It was originally conceived as a way of:
* Blogging, quickly and simply
* Removing having to rely on someone else hosting a service for your content (such as [CalePin](http://calepin.co/))
	* You retaining all publishing rights
	* You don't have to pay for expensive hosting of code (its html, css, and js only)
	* It's also crazy scalable
* Not having to have a dropbox account in order to have the joy of markdown blogging

You simply write your blog post in marklog, and click the publish and sync button ![Marklog - sync and publish](images/sync.png)

This then will generate html behind the scenes, and push it, via ftp, to your own server.

It's all quite simple really.


```
assertThat(marklog, doesNot(requireAnyCoding());
```
