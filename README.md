Marklog
=======


Marklog is an easy way to start blogging and not have waste time with server side solutions.

It allows you to type marklog (either in the editor provided, or on the filesystem), choose a template,
set your server details, and push the html to your website.

There's no html editing, and the plan is to eventually support for android devices.

This is still under active development and not even MVP complete at this stage.
