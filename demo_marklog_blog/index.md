Welcome to the Blogosphere
====


This is a demo blog in marklog, a piece of blog writing and publishing software.  

It was originally conceived as a way of:
* Removing having to rely on someone else hosting a service for your content 
	* You retaining all publishing rights
	* You don't have to pay for expensive hosting of code (its html, css, and js only)
* Removing having to have a dropbox account


You simply write your blog post in marklog, and click publish.

This then will generate html behind the scenes, and push it, via ftp, to your own server.
